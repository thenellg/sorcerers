# Sorcerers of Griffin's Apartment
I'm recreating a version of Disney's Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom for a YouTube video.

I will be creating the game such that it can be played via a browser on a laptop (maybe on a phone if I can figure out a hosting and QR code situation). TBD on that front. I will update this readme with more information once the project is complete.
